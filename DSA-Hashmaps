1. Create a HashMap class



2. WhatDoesThisDo



3. Demonstrate understanding of Hash maps




1) Show your hash map after the insertion of keys 10, 22, 31, 4, 15, 28, 17, 88, 59 into a hash map of length m = 11 using open addressing and a hash function k mod m.




2) Show your hash map after the insertion of the keys 5, 28, 19, 15, 20, 33, 12, 17, 10 into the hash map with collisions resolved by separate chaining. Let the hash table have a length m = 9, and let the hash function be k mod m.




4. Remove duplicates




5. Any permutation a palindrome




6. Anagram grouping




7. Separate Chaining
